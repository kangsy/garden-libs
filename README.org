# garden-purecss

I wanted to use some CSS frameworks within my clojure projects with [[https://github.com/noprompt/garden]]

Currently, I have converted [[https://purecss.io/][Pure CSS]] and [[http://bulma.io/][Bulma]].
As it stands now, these are conversions of the static css files and far inferior to the sass-version if it comes to customzation. So please use this with care.

## Usage

Just require the namespace and define your style like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(ns my-css.core
  (:require [garden.def :refer [defstyles]]
            [garden-libs.bulma.v0-3-1 :as bulma]))

(defstyles mycss [ ... ])
(defstyles all [bulma mycss])
#+END_SRC
